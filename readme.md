Just Turbines adds... turbines! Small inefficient ones at that.

This mod is meant to replace the early-game biomass stage of power with a method that works passively.
Turbines can also be used to provide backup bootstrapping power for when your power grid fails.

## Buildings

- Savonius Turbine: Small vertical wind turbine.

## Wind speed

A turbine's efficiency will be different depending on where it's placed.
For optimal power generation, place your turbine higher.
Turbines will generate at least 5 MW of power, but can generate up to 30 MW if placed high enough.
